üé® **Tailwind CSS for Streamlined Styling**
Leverage the power of Tailwind CSS to rapidly build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. With its utility-first approach, you can create custom designs effortlessly, saving time and ensuring consistency across your application.

üåà **Coolors.co Integration for Effortless Color Scheme Customization**
Easily personalize your application's color scheme using the Coolors.co integration. Simply provide a Coolors.co link, and watch as your chosen palette is seamlessly applied throughout your project, including the tailwind configuration, next configuration, and even the favicon.

üß© **TypeScript for Enhanced Code Quality and Scalability**
Embrace the benefits of TypeScript to write type-safe and maintainable code. Catch potential errors early in the development process and enjoy improved code intelligence and refactoring capabilities.

üç¨ **Fully Functional Navbar and Site Menu Options**
Choose from two meticulously crafted navbar and site menu configurations that are ready to use right out of the box. These fully functional components provide a professional and intuitive navigation experience for your users.

üé≠ **SVG Logo and Favicon Support**
Make your application truly yours by easily incorporating your own branding assets. The CLI supports SVG logos and favicons, ensuring that your application reflects your unique identity across all devices and platforms.

üèóÔ∏è **Automated Configuration and Setup**
Save time and focus on what matters most‚Äîbuilding your application. The NextJS Template CLI takes care of the initial configuration for essential files such as `tailwind.config.cjs`, `next.config.js`, `package.json`, `.vscode`, `postcss.config.js`, and `next-env.d.ts`. It also installs the necessary packages using Yarn, providing a hassle-free setup process.

üé® **Convenient Color Scheme Updates**
Changing your application's color scheme is a breeze with the built-in `yarn update-colors` script. Simply provide a Coolors.co link, and watch as your chosen color palette is seamlessly applied throughout your project.

üé® **Custom Logo and Colorization**

NextJS Template CLI now supports custom logo integration and automatic colorization using SVGRepo.com and Coolors.co. You can easily incorporate your own branding by selecting an SVG icon from SVGRepo.com or providing a custom URL during the project creation process.

The selected logo will be automatically colorized based on the chosen color scheme from Coolors.co, ensuring a cohesive visual identity for your project. You can preview the colorized logo before finalizing your choices, and even regenerate the SVG icon with new attributes (image, color scheme, or color order) until you're satisfied with the result.

To customize your project's logo:

1. During the project creation process, you will be prompted to select an SVG icon from SVGRepo.com or enter a custom URL.
2. Choose an icon from the provided options or enter a valid SVGRepo.com URL.
3. The CLI will fetch the selected SVG icon and generate an image preview for you to review.
4. If you want to make changes, you can regenerate the SVG icon with new attributes until you're happy with the result.
5. Once you confirm your choices, the custom logo will be integrated into your project, and the favicon and logo component will be updated accordingly.

Enjoy the flexibility and convenience of incorporating your own branding seamlessly into your NextJS projects!
