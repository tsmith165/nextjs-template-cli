## Customization and Development

The NextJS Template CLI provides a solid foundation for your project, but the real magic happens when you start customizing and building upon it. Dive into the codebase and explore the various components, pages, and configurations. Modify the styles, add new features, and make the application truly yours.

Remember to leverage the power of TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to create maintainable, efficient, and visually stunning code. The CLI sets you up for success, but the rest is up to you!

## üé® Updating Color Scheme

NextJS Template CLI makes it easy to update the color scheme of your generated project. The `update_colors` script allows you to change the colors by providing a Coolors.co URL.

To update the color scheme:

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your generated project.

2. Run the following command:

```
yarn update-colors
```

3. You will be prompted to select a color palette from a list of predefined options or enter a custom Coolors.co URL.

-   If you choose a predefined color palette, simply select it from the list.
-   If you want to use a custom color palette, select "Enter custom Coolors.co URL" and provide a valid Coolors.co URL when prompted.

4. The script will extract the color codes from the selected color palette and update the following files:

-   tailwind.config.js: The color constants in the Tailwind CSS configuration file will be updated with the new color values.
-   next.config.js: The publicRuntimeConfig.colorScheme object will be updated with the new color values.
-   public/favicon.svg: The fill color of the favicon SVG will be updated to match the new primary color.

5. The script will also run tests to ensure that the color updates were applied correctly. If the tests pass, you will see success messages indicating that the colors were updated successfully.

That's it! Your project's color scheme will now reflect the selected color palette. You can run the development server to see the updated colors in action.
